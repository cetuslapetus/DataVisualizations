# DataVisualizations

A great visualization of where mayan inscriptions have been found in Southern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Belize.
There are many things that can affect where we have found sites of interest including ability to travel to the sites, collaboration with locals or lack thereof, weather patterns affecting physical preservation, historical events affecting physical preservation and many more.
One interesting finding was that Guatemala Peten is the best area to travel to if you want to maximize the amount of inscriptions you want to see in one go within one region. However, the Campeche and Yucatan areas of Mexico are also a good bet ssince despite sites being dividedd into the two regions, the sites themselves are physically close to each other as seen on the heat map and therefore are a better target for visitors wanting to maximize the sites they see while minimizing their physical travel.
